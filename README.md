# mtm6201_final
## Overview
This is my final project for the Web Dev II course. As part of the second term of the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College, I had to create an user-friendly and effective interface for a new Recreation Centre opening soon in Ottawa. 

## Project Process
A prototype was created on Figma. For the website, I used a mobile-first responsive layout with Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS variables to adjust the color scheme for the site. 

## Challenges and Solutions
The overall challenge was balancing the prototyping and coding phases. What sometimes looks functional in a prototype might be too difficult to implement properly. 

Using Bootstrap 5 also helped me to implement the accordion for the Schedule page and make a functional carousel for the home page.

One issue I had to face between prototyping and coding was the footer not wrapping properly on smaller screens, an issue I noticed when coding. To resolve this, I created a special one-column layout footer for smaller screens.

I also decided not to use a different opening for the off-canvas menu on the tablet version. I was afraid of adding another offcanvas menu and it would make the code heavy, as I already had two navbars for the different screen sizes (mobile and desktop). 

## Technologies Used
**Bootstrap 5**: For layout and responsive design, as well as SVG icons.
**Hover.css**: For the hovering transitions on desktop. 
**Google Fonts**: For custom fonts (Raleway and DM Sans).
**Figma**: For prototyping.
**GitHub Pages**: For project hosting.
