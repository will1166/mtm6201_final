## Overview
This is my final project for the Web Dev II course. As part of the second term for the Interactive Media Design, I had to create an user-friendly and effective interface for a new Recreation Centre opening soon in Ottawa. 

## Project Process
A prototype was created on Figma. For the website, I used a mobile-first responsive layout using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS variables to adjust to the color scheme for my website. 

### Challenges and Solutions
The overall challenge was to balance between the prototyping and the coding. What sometimes looks functional, it might be too hard to make it function properly. 

Using Bootstrap 5 also helped me to implement the accordion for the Schedule page and make a functional carousel for the home page.

One issue I had to face between prototyping and coding was the footer not wrapping properly on smaller screens, an issue I noticed when coding. So I had to create a special, one-column layout footer for these smaller screens.

I also had to make the choice to not go with the different opening for the offcanvas menu on tablet version. I was afraid of adding another offcanvas menu and it would make the code heavy, as I already had two navbars for the different screen sizes (mobile and desktop). 

## Assets
